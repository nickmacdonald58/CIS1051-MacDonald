Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

As of now the code will clean the model's data and store it on a new sheet.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Analysis of the data has not been done in a meaningful way yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

First deciding what library to use within Python was frustrating. After getting the hang of openpyxl, the first time running the code saved the excel file in an'unusable format' although I am sure it was correct. This loced me out of the excel file but I was able to recover a past version with minimal damage to my progress. Now I must change the code so that it creates a new file so it does not ruin the Excel Macro's I have made once I fix them.
